TOP Foundations Recipe Project

This was a simple project to practice making a basic recipe website using html. Some of the skills I developed over the course of this assignments were:

Creating a main index file that linked to other pages
Embedding and resizing images onto web pages
Creating ordered and unordered lists to display information
How to make fraction symbols appear on the webpage correctly
